## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project I was able to become more familiar with Javascript, since I'm starting my studies in this programming language. I know some choices i made isn't the best way to do the things, but that was the way I found to solve this challenge. But, apart from that, i'm very satisfied with my desing and code.

### Continued development

I'll study more of JSON, Git and the good pratices in JS, so i can write better code every day. Since only the desktop design was done, in the next few days I will be designing for mobile.
